# agile-project

- Form groups of 3-4 people. One will be a client that wants something to be implemented. The other two the software
  engineer. The client must describe the application it needs to be implemented, be creative, it can be anything. Based
  on what you learned in the morning, try to organize a simple project to implement the project.

  - Try to identify stakeholders, those that will get impacted by the deployment of the software.
  - Try to identify the characteristics and functionalities of the project.
  - Write them down, (you can use [trello.com](trello.com) to take the notes).
  - Rank them by priority.
  - Plan a first sprint.
